  Communication takes place with the help of postback requests (postbacks).
  After each Client request for input or output, a postback is sent to the
  Client with the result of the operation.

# üîô Postback

Funds should only be credited to your users based on the amount specified in the postback. Similarly, funds should only be debited from your users according to the amount indicated in the postback.

### Receiving the postback <a href="#postbacken-receivingthepostback-postbake" id="postbacken-receivingthepostback-postbake"></a>

To accept postbacks, you need to implement a separate path that you can use to receive postbacks. They are sent via a POST request in JSON format.

The A-pay server is waiting for a response in json

```json
{ 
"status": "OK" 
}
```

Response code 200, otherwise, when receiving a different response, A-pay will forward the postback with a certain frequency.

#### Client-side signature generation

When sending webhooks, A-Pay also sends a signature: a specifically generated hash string that is created using a private key.

**The signature itself is calculated as follows:**

```json
$signature = sha1($access_key . $private_key . md5($transactions->toJson(JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE)));
```

**a string of three parameters is passed to the sha1 function:**

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $access\_key  | The public key is specified in the settings of the A-Pay technical support personal account  |
| $private\_key | The private key is specified in the settings of the A-Pay technical support personal account |
| md5(...)      | Hash from the MD5 function of the entire array of transactions in JSON format                |

As a result of executing this code, a string is obtained that cannot be faked without having a private key that is not passed in webhooks.

The client can compare the generated signature with the received signature from the webhook and thereby make sure that the data that came was actually sent and not faked by a scammer.

The webhook will include the status of the transactions:

* If the status is ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù, the client should proceed with depositing the funds into the user account.
* If the status is ‚ÄúFailed‚Äù or ‚ÄúRejected,‚Äù no funds should be deposited, or the deposit should be canceled.

**The signature itself is calculated as follows:**

```json
$signature = sha1($access_key . $private_key . md5($transactions->toJson(JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE)));
```

**a string of three parameters is passed to the sha1 function:**

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                  |

| md5(...)      | Hash from the MD5 function of the entire array of transactions in JSON format                |

As a result of executing this code, a string is obtained that cannot be faked without having a private key that is not passed in webhooks.

The webhook will include the status of the transactions:

#### **Expected responses to postbacks from a client:**

| –°ode | Message                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 200  | Ok                       |
| 400  | error receiving          |
| 401  | error validation         |
| 404  | not found http exception |
| 500  | not enough fields        |
| 501  | empty postback           |
| 502  | incorrect signature      |
| 503  | data integrity error     |

* If successful, expect the client to have http status - 2XX.
* &#x20;All 200th codes should be accompanied by "status" = "ok"
* In case of failure, expect from the client http status other than 2XX (depending on the error) and an error message. For example, "error validation" or "not enough fields".&#x20;

# ðŸš€ Start Integration

A-Pay provides APIs (x2x, h2h, server-to-server, post-to-post) as well as a payment gateway (page) integration to process your transactions.

* **API Integration**: You develop and maintain all the interfaces for your customers.
* **Payment Gateway**: A-Pay provides the interface for customer payments.
* **Telegram Integration**: Use Telegram to interact with A-Payâ€™s services, allowing customers to receive payment notifications, confirm transactions, and even make payments directly via the app.

You can integrate the payment gateway, use the API, and incorporate Telegram at the same time, so the way of integration depends only on your desire!

In all cases, integration requires implementation into your back-end.

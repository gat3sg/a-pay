### Payment system data is not valid <a href="#id-dokumentaciya-paymentsystemdataisnotvalid" id="id-dokumentaciya-paymentsystemdataisnotvalid"></a>

The data in the data parameter is invalid, or the field is missing. Our client either does not send the data parameter in the request or sends incorrect data in this parameter.

**How can you resolve it by yourself?** Using the deposit creation as an example:

[Link](https://api.a-pay.one/#tag/Deposit/paths/~1Remotes~1create-deposit/post) -> Data -> one of PS, for example, M-Pesa.

You must send for the mpesa payment system a cell phone number

If you do send a number, please note that it must be a 12-digit number. This is specified in string `[12..12]`

# Telegram Payments

With Telegram Payments and A-Pay, you can send specially formatted invoice messages to your customers.

Invoice messages feature a photo and description of the product, along with a prominent Pay button. Tapping this button opens a special payment interface in the Telegram app. In this interface, users choose the A-Pay Payment Method and tap the final pay button in Telegram.

At that moment, the A-Pay Payment Page opens, and the customers can choose the preferable Payment Method among all the A-Pay provides for the current currency. After that, customers should follow the steps for the selected method.

When it’s done, your bot should proceed crediting the funds to the customer’s account.
